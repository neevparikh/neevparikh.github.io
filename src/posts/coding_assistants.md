I think coding assistants will be less like IDE integrations and more like autonomous code-monkeys.[^1] I have three basic reasons why I think this is true:

1. You're going to want to run *many* of them at a time. 
2. Autonomous agents scale better with model capabilities. 
3. Interactive editing plays poorly with high-latency. 

[^1]: I'm talking about something like Cursor's [Agent mode](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent). I think AI-assisted *autocomplete* is still useful and will continue to be valuable.
