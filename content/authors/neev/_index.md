Hi! I'm a concurrent graduate/undergraduate student at Brown University, with research interests in reinforcement learning, robotics, distributed RL and planning. I currently work in the Intelligent Robot Lab at Brown University, led by Professor George Konidaris. I'm also interested in industry work for a full-time position (2022). For a resume, please click [here](files/neev_parikh_resume.pdf).
